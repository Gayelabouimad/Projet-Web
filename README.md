# Projet-Web

[x] 1 – Show the list “game, score board, about” as a navigation bar fixed at the top of the screen.
[x] 2 – Design the 3 different sections of this website (try to be as creative as possible)
Game : it only shows the game.
Score Board: it shows the top 10 scores. Fields are name, email, country and score. Generate them as dummy data if you fail to complete the extra points tasks.
About: just a simple about screen.
[x] 3 – User should be able to navigate between those 3 sections either by scrolling or by using the navigation bar.
[ ] 4 – Replace the player and pipes inside the game with sprites.
[ ] 5 – Put a background image for the canvas. 
[ ] 6 – The player position should remain idle and pipes should not appear before the user presses space for the first time.
[ ] 7 – Remove the pause and resume buttons and make the game toggle between pause and resume by pressing the “p” key.
[ ] 8 – When the user looses a view overlay the canvas instead of the current alert dialog. This view should include the user score and a form where he can input his name, country and email.
Extra points:
[x] 9.a – Populate the scores from a json file. 
[ ] 9.b – Save the scores from a json file. 
[ ] 10 – Display the name, country and email form only if the user has a new high score.
